## Overview
Welcome to the "Predicting Primary Causes of Car Accidents in Chicago" project! Our goal is to build a predictive model that classifies and predicts the primary contributory cause of car accidents in the Chicago area. By analyzing a rich dataset and leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to shed light on the factors leading to accidents, from distracted driving to adverse weather conditions.

## Problem Statement
### Why It Matters
The primary contributory cause of an accident can provide crucial insights for various stakeholders, including law enforcement, traffic management agencies, and public safety organizations. Understanding the main causes of accidents is vital for:
- Proactive accident prevention.
- Traffic rule enforcement.
- Public safety enhancement.

Our project's primary problem is to predict the contributory cause of car accidents in Chicago accurately.

## Data Overview
### Unveiling Valuable Insights
Our dataset is a treasure trove of information related to car accidents in Chicago. It offers a comprehensive view of various aspects, including:
- Vehicle details.
- Individual involvement.
- Road conditions.
- Weather factors.
- And much more.

## Methodology
### Our Approach
In this project, we have employed the logistic regression technique for building the predictive model.

## Model Building
### Bringing It to Life
We've used a logistic regression model to make predictions about the primary contributory cause of car accidents.

## Model Evaluation
### Assessing Performance
To gauge the model's effectiveness, we've evaluated it using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**: 0.3820
- **Precision**: 0.2349
- **Recall**: 0.3820
- **F1-Score**: 0.2449

Additionally, we've visualized the model's performance using a confusion matrix.

## Results
### The Bigger Picture
Our model, while showing promise, offers room for improvement. Detailed analysis and additional feature engineering can contribute to its enhanced accuracy.

## Conclusion
### Onward and Upward
The "Predicting Primary Causes of Car Accidents in Chicago" project is a significant step toward understanding and predicting the primary contributory causes of accidents. As we continue to fine-tune our model, we aim to deliver even more accurate predictions and contribute to safer roads in Chicago and beyond.
